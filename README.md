# moviescore

This is just a "for fun" project. This project basically automatically find the updated movies from NowTV OnDemand (a movie platform that I normally used to rent and watch movie) and find out its scores in rotten tomatoes. This project consisted of 2 files so far. 

1. rottentomatoes.py
This python program takes input and find the scores of the movie in rottentomatoes.com

2. movies.py
Find all the updated movies from NowTV OnDemand and feed it into rottentomatoes.py to find out the score.

This project may be developed into a website or something for self-use.
